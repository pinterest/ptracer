.. module:: ptracer
    :synopsis: On-demand system call tracing in Python programs.

.. currentmodule:: ptracer

**ptracer** is a library providing on-demand, programmatic system call tracing
in Python programs using
`ptrace <http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/man2/ptrace.2.html>`_.

**ptracer** works on Python 2.7 and Python 3.5 or later.  Currently, only
64-bit Linux platforms are supported.


.. _ptracer-installation:

Installation
============

**ptracer** has no external dependencies and the recommended way to
install it is to use **pip**:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install ptracer


Building from source
--------------------

If you want to build **ptracer** from a Git checkout you will need:

  * A working C compiler.
  * CPython header files.  These can usually be obtained by installing
    the relevant Python development package: **python-dev**/**python3-dev**
    on Debian/Ubuntu, **python-devel**/**python3-devel** on RHEL/Fedora.

Once the above requirements are satisfied, use the usual ``setup.py`` commands
or ``pip install -e .`` to install the newly built version in development mode.


Running tests
-------------

To execute the testsuite simply run:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python setup.py test


.. _ptracer-usage:

ptracer Usage
=============

The most common way of tracing a block of code is to surround it with the
:func:`context` context manager:

.. code-block:: python

    import traceback
    import ptracer

    def callback(syscall):
        print('{}({}) -> {}'.format(
            syscall.name,
            ', '.join(repr(arg.value) for arg in syscall.args),
            syscall.result.text))
        print('Traceback: ')
        print(''.join(traceback.format_list(syscall.traceback)))

    with ptracer.context(callback):
        open('/dev/null', 'wb')

``ptracer`` also provides the explicit :func:`enable` and
:func:`disable` functions to begin and terminate tracing.


Filtering
---------

Ptracer allows elaborate syscall filtering via the *filter* argument:

.. code-block:: python

    flt = [
        ptracer.SysCallPattern(
            name='open',
            args=[
                re.compile(b'/tmp/.*'),
                lambda arg: arg.value & os.O_WRONLY
            ],
            result=lambda res: res.value > 0
        )
    ]

    with ptracer.context(callback, filter=flt):
        # traced code
        ...


In the above example, ptracer will invoke the callback only for successful
attempts to open files in the "/tmp" directory for writing.

See the documentation for the
:class:`SysCallPattern` class for more
information on setting up filters.


.. _ptracer-api-reference:

Module Reference
================

.. function:: context(callback, filter=None)

   Set up and return a tracing context object that should be used as a context
   manager.  Tracing will begin once the context manager block is entered,
   and will terminate on block exit.

   The *callback* parameter specifies a callable that should accept a
   :class:`SysCall` instance as a single argument.  The *callback* is
   invoked asynchronously in a thread separate from the traced program.

   If *filter* is not ``None``, it is expected to contain a
   :class:`SysCallPattern` instance or an iterable of ``SysCallPattern``
   instances.  The *callback* will be called if the syscall matches any of
   the provided patterns.  If *filter* is ``None``, no filtering is done,
   and *callback* will be invoked for every syscall.


.. function:: enable(callback, filter=None)

   Start tracing of the current program immediately.  The *callback* and
   *filter* arguments have the same meaning as in :func:`context`.  To stop
   tracing call :func:`disable`.


.. function:: disable()

   Stop tracing of the current program.


.. class:: SysCall

   A description of a system call performed by a program.  ``SysCall``
   instances are passed to the callback passed to :func:`context` or
   :func:`enable`.

   .. attribute:: name

      The name of the system call.  If the name could not be identified,
      the property will contain ``'<syscallnumber>'``, where ``syscallnumber``
      is a platform-specific integer representing the system call.

   .. attribute:: pid

      The system identifier of the OS thread in which the system call
      was performed.

   .. attribute:: args

      A list of :class:`SysCallArg` instances representing the system call
      arguments.  The values of the arguments are taken *after* the system
      call exit.

   .. attribute:: result

      An instance of :class:`SysCallResult` representing the system call
      return value.

   .. attribute:: traceback

      A list of stack trace entries similar to the one returned by
      :func:`traceback.extract_stack <python:traceback.extract_stack>`.

      The trace corresponds to the call stack which triggered the system call.


.. class:: SysCallArg

   A description of a system call argument.  Instances of :class:`SysCall`
   contain a list of ``SysCallArg`` objects in the ``args`` attribute.

   .. attribute:: name

      The name of the syscall parameter.  If the name could not be identified,
      this property will contain ``paramN`` for the N-th argument.

   .. attribute:: type

      The type of the syscall parameter represented by a :class:`CType`
      instance.  If the real type could not be identified, the type will
      be reported as ``unsigned long``.

   .. attribute:: raw_value

      An integer representing the raw value of the syscall argument.

   .. attribute:: value

      An object representing the unpacked value of the syscall argument
      according to its type.  For pointer values this will be the dereferenced
      value.  Known types will be converted into corresponding Python values.


.. class:: SysCallResult

   A description of a system call return value.  Instances of :class:`SysCall`
   contain an ``SysCallResult`` object in the ``result`` attribute.

   .. attribute:: type

      The type of the syscall return value represented by a :class:`CType`
      instance.  If the real type could not be identified, the type will
      be reported as ``unsigned long``.

   .. attribute:: raw_value

      An integer representing the raw value of the syscall return value.

   .. attribute:: value

      An object representing the unpacked value of the syscall return value
      according to its type.  For pointer values this will be the dereferenced
      value.  Known types will be converted into corresponding Python values.


.. class:: CType

   A description of a system call value type.

   .. attribute:: names

      A list of tokens in the C declaration of the type.  For example,
      ``'unsigned long'`` will be represented as ``['unsigned', 'long']``.

   .. attribute:: ctype

      A :ref:`ctypes data type <python:ctypes-fundamental-data-types>`.

   .. attribute:: ptr_indirection

      The number of pointer indirections.  For example, a ``'const char **'``
      type will have ``ptr_indirection`` of ``2``, and the ``ctype`` attribute
      set to :class:`c_char <python:ctypes.c_char>`.


.. class:: SysCallPattern(name=None, args=None, result=None)

   An object used to match system calls.  *name*, *args*, and *result* specify
   the *patterns* for the corresponding attributes of the :class:`SysCall`
   object.  If specified, *args*, should be a list of patterns matching the
   order of syscall arguments, and not all arguments have to be listed.
   Each pattern value can be:

   - A callable that receives a :class:`SysCallArg` or a :class:`SysCallResult`
     instance and returns ``True`` when the value matches, and ``False``
     otherwise.

   - An object with a ``match()`` method that received an unpacked value
     of a syscall attribute and returns ``True`` when the value matches, and
     ``False`` otherwise.
     A :ref:`regular expression object <python:re-objects>` can be used.
     For example:  ``SysCallPattern(name=re.compile('open.*'))``.

   - Any python object, which is compared with the unpacked value directly.

   .. method:: match(syscall)

      Return ``True`` if *syscall* matches the pattern and ``False`` otherwise.
